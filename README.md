# Node.js-challenge

## Description
This is the repository for the 07-Node.js challenge for the Bootcamp Web Development course that I am taking. It is a README generator that can be executed through a terminal and will generate a properly formatted readme.md file. This repository contains all the files for the challenge, except for the "inquirer" dependency and the "node_modules" files.

## Link
I've attached the link to a walkthrough video that goes through the process of generating a readME.md with the program. [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NVrNO2V0rrqx1jBx5d1-AVQaPpuCD4i_?usp=sharing)
